Description          "[h1]Original Mod[/h1]\n By murgh https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265109999\n\n[h1]Changes[/h1]\n- Fixed the No equipment error in the programs tab (Thx to Typpi https://steamcommunity.com/id/Typpilol for the fix)\n\n [h1]Disclaimer[/h1] This a updated version of the original mod. I am not the original author and don't claim any ownership, the original author can message me to request a take down of the mod if they so choose.\n\n [h1]Original Description[/h1] \nComplete solution for your Workshop supply!\nIncludes:\na Prisoner Forestry to chop fast growing trees,\na new Wood Workshop with a WoodSaw to cut your Logs into Wood,\nStorage Racks for Log, Wood and Metal.\n\n[h1]USAGE[/h1]\nResearch Prison Labour and Grounds Keeping first. Place a little enclosed [b]Prisoner Forestry[/b] on an empty piece of land. Then plant some Forestry Trees, schedule a Tree Chopping program, and send a few prisoners to work there. Trees grow FAST, you don't need many! One or two Log Storage Racks will be nice as well.\n\nBuild a [b]Wood Workshop[/b], place 2 or 3 WoodSaws plus a few Log and/or Wood Storage Racks, depending on your needs. Workmen will be able to operate the WoodSaw in order to maintain a steady supply of Wood. You can send one or two prisoners to work here, but that would be a waste of manpower.\n\nExpand your normal [b]Workshop[/b] with a few Wood Storage Racks to buffer the supply coming from your Wood Workshop. You can also place a Metal Storage Rack to have a steady supply of SheetMetal.\n\n\n[h1]WORKFLOW[/h1]\n Assign MORE prisoners than available Saws, Presses and CarpenterTables in your Workshop. So if you placed 15 presses / saws / carpentry tables, then assign 20-25 people to have at least 5-10 prisoners available to carry stuff. You can assign a maximum of 100 prisoners since PA update 13.\n\nAvailable prisoners in the normal Workshop will distribute materials between all other workshops you might have. This means:\n- Prisoners assigned in the normal Workshop can provide SheetMetal to WorkshopSaw, WorkshopPress, PhoneTable, and Metal Storage Racks.\n- They also carry Log from Prisoner Forestry to WoodSaw, WorkshopSaw and Log Storage Rack.\n- And they handle Wood between WoodSaw, CarpentryTable, CoffinTable and Wood Storage Rack.\n - When you build modded workshops, assign the SAME amount of prisoners as there are processors available in those rooms. There is no need to assign more than 4 prisoners to your Phone Factory if you only have 4 PhoneTables to make phones. Prisoners working in other workshops than the default one will NOT carry materials to their processors, only operate them.\n\n\n[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]\nSupports the Cemetery and Explosive SmartPhone mods to provide Wood to CoffinTables and SheetMetal to PhoneTables as well. Place this mod on top of those two in your mods list if you use them.\n\n\n[h1]NEW OBJECTS[/h1]\nWoodSaw -- operated by Workman and Prisoner in a Wood Workshop\nLog Storage Rack -- for your Prisoner Forestry and/or Wood Workshop\nWood Storage Rack -- for your Wood Workshop and/or Workshop\nMetal Storage Rack -- for your 'Smart' Phone Factory and/or Workshop\nForestry Tree Sapling -- for your Prisoner Forestry\nSmall Table -- optional, for Workshop, 'Smart' Phone Factory, Coffin Workshop, Wood Workshop\nSmall Wooden Garden Table -- optional, for Wood Workshop (also for Recycling mod)\n\n\n[h1]NEW ROOMS[/h1]\nPrisoner Forestry\nWood Workshop\n\n\n[h1]NEW REFORM[/h1]\nTree Chopping\nWood Work\n\n\n[h1]RESEARCH[/h1]\nYou will need to research Prison Labour and Grounds Keeping.\n\n\n[h1]NOTES[/h1]\n - The Prisoner Forestry does NOT work with the standard Trees. It requires a special type of fast growing Forestry Tree. Make sure there are no normal Trees in your Prisoner Forestry, they would be a waste of space...\n\n - Since the Forestry Trees grow fast, you don't need a huge Prisoner Forestry to generate a lot of wood. A convenient little area where you grow a few trees will be more than enough to start with.\n\n - Only Prisoners will chop these Forestry Trees! You need Gardeners to plant them.\n\n - The Metal Storage Rack will auto order metal to provide a buffer.\n\n - The default WorkshopSaw should now get SheetMetal at a higher priority than Wood, to have a clear separation between Metal and Wood production lines. However, the game engine seems to have a different opinion about that.\n\n\n\n*Screen shots taken from True Island map:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1093878417\n\nPlease don't forget to press the Like button if you like this mod.\nFeel free to check out [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/murgh/myworkshopfiles/?appid=233450]my workshop[/url] with tons of handy mods!\n\nNon-Steam users: follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1324969702]this guide[/url] to download manually.\nFollow [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1918148552]this guide[/url] to remove mods.
